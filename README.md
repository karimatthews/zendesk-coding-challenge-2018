# Zendesk Coding Challenge 2018

This is my solution to the Zendesk Seach CLI coding challenge. It uses Ruby, as this is currently the language I'm most familiar with.

## Usage

After cloning the repo you can run `bundle install` to install dependencies. You will also need Ruby 2.5.3 installed.

From your project directory run

```
ruby 'bin/search_cli.rb'
```

and follow the prompts.

## Running Tests

To run the test suite you can run this line from the project directory:

```
  ruby test/test_all.rb
```

## Assumptions
- It's unlikely Zendesk is giving out sensitive customer data to candidates, so the `data` folder has been committed.
- We can rely on the user to specify the type of resource and the specific field they're looking for.
- We don't need to return all the data of the associated resources, just a name/subject and ID so that the user can easily find more information if they need it.
- The user may or may not be technical


## What to Expect

When you run this program you should expect to see this welcome message. The tool will also let you know it is reading your data.

You will then be asked which dataset you would like to search:

![resource request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16496109/48670918-867ef100-eb74-11e8-9902-732e1c9d9b45.png)

Once you specify a resource and hit enter you will be shown field options based on which resource you have selected.

Once you select a valid field option you will be asked to input a search term:

What your results look like will depened on the resource you're searching. Examples are shown below.
