# Zendesk Coding Challenge 2018

This is my solution to the Seach CLI coding challenge.it uses Ruby, as this is currently the language I'm most familiar with.

## Setup

After cloning the repo you can run `bundle install` to install dependencies.

## Running Tests

To run the test suite you can run this line from the project directory:

```
  ruby test/test_all.rb
```
